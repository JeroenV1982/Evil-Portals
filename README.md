## Foose Evil Portals

[Foose Evil Portals](https://github.com/SgtFoose/Evil-Portals) is my collection of portals that can be loaded into the Evil Portal module and can be used for phishing attacks against WiFi clients in order to obtain credentials or infect the victims with malware using the [Hak5](https://hak5.org/) [WiFi Pineapple Mark VII](https://wifipineapple.com/) 

These projects have been tested on the Pineapple MK7 with the following firmwares:

1.0.0 not tested

1.0.1 not tested

1.0.2 Works! [Link](https://downloads.hak5.org/api/devices/wifipineapplemk7/firmwares/1.0.2-stable)

1.1.1 Works! [Link](https://downloads.hak5.org/api/devices/wifipineapplemk7/firmwares/1.1.1-stable)

2.0.0 Works but requeire special settings, recommended to wait till stable release.

#### Installation of the Portals
Installation can be done in atleast two ways:

Option 1: From your PC/Desktop:
Download the repository form [Github](https://github.com/SgtFoose/Evil-Portals) (green code button top right / download ZIP)

Extract the files on your computer (e.g. \Downloads\Evil-Portals-main\Evil-Portals-main\Portals).

You can use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to copy the portals on the Pineapple MK7 in folder /root/portals/.
Make sure to only copy the Portals, not the entire folder! On the MK7 it should look like this example: /root/portals/ziggo-login/ (not /root/portals/Evil-Portals-main\Evil-Portals-main\Portals\ziggo-login).

Host: sftp://172.16.42.1 Username: root Password: yourpassword Port: 22

Finally on the WiFi Pineapple web interface, start the Evil Portal module and then activate the portal you wish to use.

After gathering credentials, captured data will be shown as a notification on the WiFi Pineapple web interface. Logs are found at Modules > Evil Portal > Logs > View.



Option 2: From your Pineapple Console:

You need a program to unzip the portals. I used InfoZIP's "unzip" which can be found in your Packages page of the Pineapple. Make sure this is installed before you continue!

Download the portals from Github using the following command:

wget https://github.com/SgtFoose/Evil-Portals/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -O /root/portals/portals.zip

---

Next, we need to verify our process. Type these console commands:

cd ..

cd root (it looks like nothing happens with this step, please continue)

cd portals

ls (to verify if portals.zip is in your folder, if succeeded, proceed to the next steps)

Alternative way of verifying:
With the Module "Cabinet" from the Download Modules page, you can browse / verify the content in this folder:

/root/portals

In here, you will find a new file called "Portals.zip". If success, jump back in the Pineapple console and cd back into this "/root/portals" folder.

---

Next, we need to unzip the portals with the following console command:

unzip portals.zip (this will start extracting the portals into a folder named "Evil-Portals-main")

---

Next, we need to move the downloaded portals into the correct folder. 
Again we have alteast two options:

Option 1: Use your Pineapple's browser called "Cabinet" to move the desired Portals from this folder "/root/portals/Evil-Portals-main/Portals/mcdonalds-login" (e.g. mcdonalds-login) to folder "/root/portals/".



Option 2: If you want to copy all availlible portals, use this command in the Pineapple console:

mv -v -i /root/portals/Evil-Portals-main/Portals/* /root/portals/

If you just want one of the portals, simply replace the "*" with the name of the desired Portal:

mv -v -i /root/portals/Evil-Portals-main/Portals/mcdonalds-login /root/portals/

---

Next, we need to verify the content of the Portals folder with command:

ls

You should see something like this:

root@mk7:~/portals: ls
Evil-Portals-main  mcdonalds-login    portals.zip        ziggo-login
root@mk7:~/portals:

If everything worked out well, please continue!

---

#### Usage
Ok, downloading and installing is now complete!

Next, close the console and open your Evil Portal and they should now appear. If not, jump out of the Portal Page and come back which will refresh the portal list.

Make sure both the Evil Portals Web Server and Module have started and make sure your portal is "Activated" which can be verified using the "Preview" button.

---

Please note Firmware 2.0.0. currently has an SSL issue on the EP module. If the preview does not work, please take these steps:

On the Pineapple, edit the file
/etc/config/nginx

and change
    option uci_enable 'true'
to
    option uci_enable 'false'

Reboot the Pineapple

Verify

#### Firmware
If you like to up or downgrade your Mark VII, I strongly recoomend to use [these](https://docs.hak5.org/wifi-pineapple/faq/factory-reset-and-recovery) steps first.

Then, use one of the [.bin](https://downloads.hak5.org/api/devices/wifipineapplemk7/firmwares) files to upgrade.
